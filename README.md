# Img2Term
### Render images in the terminal!

## Demo
![example](./demo.png)

### Note: This project is a work in progress.

### How to test:
Go into `main.py` and change `im = Image.open('img4.png')` to `im = Image.open('your_image_path.png')` and just run the script.

Don't worry, this should become more framework-like (meaning OOP :D) soon.
